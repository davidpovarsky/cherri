# Project Board

This is a living working-memory document for this repository.
It is intentionally lightweight. Humans and coding agents should update it when useful discoveries, ideas, plans, optimizations, problems, or follow-up work arise during normal development.
Do not turn this into a duplicate issue tracker or a dump of temporary thoughts.

## Inbox

Quick captures that still need classification.

## Ideas & Opportunities

Potential improvements, features, optimizations, or architectural ideas.

## Discoveries & Tips
### Cherri investigation notes (2026-10-06)

- **Named Magic Variable optimization:** Real Shortcut evidence shows that an action output can use `CustomOutputName`, and subsequent references can point directly to the original `ActionOutput`, allowing some usages of `Set Variable` to potentially be eliminated. Investigate compiler/decompiler support and when this transformation is semantically safe. This may affect the compiler, decompiler, corpus analyzer, structural comparator, generated action metadata/docs, Skill behavior, and iOS/app consumers if shared metadata needs extension. This is an investigation opportunity, not an implemented optimization.
- **Inline type coercion / Magic Variable coercion:** Real Shortcut evidence shows that a downstream input can reference an existing action output with `WFCoercionVariableAggrandizement`, for example `CoercionItemClass: WFContactContentItem`. This allowed a vCard/file output to feed Choose from List as contacts without a separate `is.workflow.actions.detect.contacts` action. Investigate whether this generalizes to other Shortcuts content types and whether Cherri can use it to avoid redundant conversion/detection actions. This is an investigation opportunity, not an implemented feature.


Useful technical discoveries, undocumented behavior, shortcuts, implementation tricks, platform behavior, or reusable knowledge discovered while working.

## Experiments / Investigations

Things worth testing or researching before deciding whether to implement them.

## Open Questions

Important unresolved questions or uncertainties.
